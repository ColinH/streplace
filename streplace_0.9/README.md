# streplace v0.9 (old original source)

This directory contains the historic source for the old version of streplace (versions 0.9.x).

This old version of streplace has a lot of features but the source is hard to maintain and has multiple stylistic shortcomings.
The author always envisioned to completely rewrite it in a clean way, but never got to it until 2022.

This is no longer maintained except for ocasional compiler compatibility patches.

## License change from GPLv2 to MIT

The original versions of streplace up to 0.9.37 all have been released under the GPLv2.
The author re-released it under the MIT license in order to align with the new
version of streplace which is released under the MIT license.

(A lot of good projects made positive experiences with permissive licenses and the advantages
of copyleft licenses diminished over the years as commercial and open source software development
no longer contradicted each other.)
